To improve problem-solving skills, follow these steps:

Devise a plan for solving problems.
Understand the problem.
Explore concrete examples.
Break it down into smaller steps.
Solve or simplify each step.
Look back and refactor your solution.
Example: Write a function that adds two numbers.

Understand the problem: The function should take two numbers as inputs and return their sum.
Explore concrete examples: For example, add(3, 5) should return 8.
Break it down:
Create a function that takes two number parameters.
Add the two numbers together.
Return the sum.
Solve/simplify: Write the code for adding the numbers and returning the sum.
Look back and refactor: Review your solution, test it with different inputs, and consider ways to improve it. Also, learn from other people's approaches to similar problems.
By following these steps, you can enhance your problem-solving abilities.
